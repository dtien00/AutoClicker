# AutoClicker
An autoclicker that allows the user to input however many times they want to click repeatedly within a given range.

The autoclicker program is designed to be run from the terminal or from whatever IDE.

When run, there will be a prompt asking how many times you would like to click repeatedly, which will occur after a short delay to allow the user to move or change windows to the item they want to click on. Afterwards, they will be asked if they want to rerun the prompt again.
